# use of having clause
# write a query top find a country where only one customer is there
select country from amazon group by country having count(*)=1;

# where clause is used to filter the records before grouping and having clause is used to filter the records after grouping

# how to use group concant
# group concat is used to concatenate the values of a column into a single string

# for example, if we have a table with customer id and order id, we can use group concat to get a list of order ids for each customer id

# write a query to print distinct states present in the dataset for each country
select country, group_concat(state) as states_from_country from amazon group by country;

#to remove duplicates from the list of states, we can use distinct keyword in group_concat function
select country, group_concat( distinct state) as states_from_country from amazon group by country;

# write a query to print distinct states present in the dataset for each country and order them in descending order 
select country, group_concat( distinct state order by state desc) as states_from_country from amazon group by country;

#separator keyword is used to specify the separator between the values in the concatenated string. By default, it is comma(,). We can change it to any other character or string.
# for example, if we want to use space as separator, we can use the following query
select country, group_concat( distinct state order by state desc separator '-') as states_from_country from amazon group by country;
